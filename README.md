# Bakery Transactions Data Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of a bakery's transactional data. The dataset includes over 20,000 transactions, capturing various aspects such as the items purchased, the date and time of the transactions, and whether the transaction occurred on a weekday or weekend.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore the dataset, uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior, and provide actionable insights for the bakery's operations. This analysis was conducted as part of a guided project to enhance my data analysis skills.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns in customer purchasing behavior, such as popular items, peak times of day, and differences between weekdays and weekends.
- **Visualization**: Utilize various visualization techniques to communicate findings effectively.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, provide recommendations to the bakery for optimizing their operations and marketing strategies.

## Dataset

- **TransactionNo**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Items**: The item(s) purchased in each transaction.
- **DateTime**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **Daypart**: Part of the day when the transaction occurred (e.g., Morning, Afternoon).
- **DayType**: Type of day (e.g., Weekend, Weekday).

## Results and Insights

The analysis reveals key insights into customer behavior, such as the most popular items, peak sales times, and how purchasing habits differ between weekdays and weekends. These insights can help the bakery optimize its inventory, marketing, and staffing strategies.

## Future Work

Further analysis could include:

- Predictive modeling to forecast sales trends.
- Sentiment analysis on customer feedback (if available).
- Expansion of the analysis to include more sophisticated time-series analysis.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of data analysis techniques to real-world data, providing valuable insights that can drive business decisions.
